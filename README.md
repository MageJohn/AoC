# AoC: Advent of Code

This repo is a place to keep solutions I've written to (Advent of
Code)[https://adventofcode.com] programming problems. Advent of Code is a yearly
event run by (Eric Wastl)[was.tl]. I've not always had time to participate
during actual advent, but I come back to the problems occaisionally, especially
if I want to give a newly discovered language a workout. Given this, don't
expect the solutions given to be good (whatever that means), or the code to be
ideomatic or well thought through. The code is shared publicly for the interest
of anybody who might happen to drop by.

Not all the code I've written for AoC over the years is here. Some is in other
repos, and some was kept locally and may even now be lost.
